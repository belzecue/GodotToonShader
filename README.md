# GodotToonShader
An implementation of a custom toon shader made with Godot shading language. 

GodotToonShader is my first spatial shader made with Godot Engine. At the current stage it is very simple, but it works. Some customization will come. I hope to help someone out there who was struggling to create shader like me.
